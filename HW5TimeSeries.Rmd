#ARIMA(0,1,3)(0,1,1)[12] is the best ARIMA model. In the non-seasonal part, 0 means there are 0 auto regression components, indicating the model uses only recent data to predict future values. The 1 means there is a difference factor of one in the forecast to make the time series stationary. The 3 means there are 3 moving average components, showing that the model learns from past errors to forecast. In the seasonal part, 0 means there is no auto regression component, and 1 means there is a difference factor of 1 applied to make the time series stationary. The last 1 means there is 1 moving average component, indicating the model learns from seasonal errors. 
#This ARIMA model has the lowest BIC of 4532.72, so it is the best model to use.
#Also, the MAPE of this model is 9.2313, meaning the model has an average error of 9%.
#The residuals of this forecast are minimal, as the histogram shows most of the errors are close to 0.
#The forecast predicts that the wind power production will increase in March and April of 2023 to 45636.08, but then decrease sharply from May to June to 32785.16.
